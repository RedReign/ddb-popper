## What it does
Adds a button to the 5e Actor Sheet that opens a popup of the matching D&D Beyond character for the actor.

## How to install it
1. Download the zip file
2. Unzip into the /public/modules/ folder in your Foundry VTT installation

It should look like this when installed:

## How to use it

**IMPORTANT** Ensure you have logged into D&D Beyond in the same browser as your Foundry window to ensure that you have an authentication cookie for the popup to use.

1. Open the Actor sheet of the character you want to have linked to D&D Beyond. 
2. Click the new **DDB** button in the header bar near the Close button:

4. From now on when you click the **DDB** button on that actor sheet it will open the D&D Beyond popup or "focus" it if it is already open

Note: if you want to change/remove the URL for an actor, simply right-click the **DDB** button to open the form again

## TODO

* Automatically close the DDB popup when the actor sheet is closed
